# snake
The Snake game project is a classic and popular game implemented in C++23 specifically for Linux terminals. It offers a
fun and engaging gaming experience directly within the terminal environment.

To compile the project, navigate to the root directory and execute the following commands:

    $ cmake .
    $ make

After the compilation is complete, a file named "snake" will appear in the directory. To run the game, simply execute
the command "./snake" without any parameters.

Ensure that the logged-in user has the necessary permissions (read, write, and execute) for the project directory. These
permissions are crucial for the game's settings, best scores files, and the ability to load saved games. These files
will be stored in the "files" directory.

Upon launching the game, a menu will be displayed, similar to the example image provided.

The game features regular food, superfood power-ups, a progressively increasing velocity based on the amount of food
consumed, the ability to enable or disable the border, pause functionality, and the option to save the game for later
continuation.
