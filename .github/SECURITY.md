# Security Policy - Project Maintenance

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability or any issue that could
potentially compromise the security of our project, please report it to us through GitHub's issue tracking system.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.
2. Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/adrianovaladar/snake/issues) section of our GitHub repository.
3. Click on "New Issue" to create a new issue.
4. Provide a clear description of the vulnerability and any relevant information to help us understand and reproduce it.
5. If possible, provide steps to reproduce the vulnerability or a proof-of-concept (POC).

We appreciate your effort in responsibly disclosing security concerns, and we will make our best efforts to address them
in a timely manner.

## Scope

Please note that this security policy applies to this project and any maintained releases or branches. If a
vulnerability is found in a legacy or outdated version of the project that is no longer actively maintained, we may not
be able to provide a fix. However, we encourage users to keep their installations up to date to benefit from the latest
security enhancements.
